Back in the "good old days" before cap ships, flying through the gate could be dangerous.

While this is less of a issue these days, for newer players without cap ships looking to mine in Ely they need to pass the iconic chokepoint.

Should piracy ever return to its former glory, this hauler and miner serve to help start out in spite of the danger.

A new player can grind mats/credits in SZ and build a small fleet of these haulers/miners to prevent being stone aged trying to set up on Ely.

I personally recommend setting a station in the Ely belt and building a small hanger to refill and repair the ships.

While not meta tanked, the ship has a generous 2 layer char firewall at the rear, and a char cockpit shield, meant to make easy crit hits a little less easy.

These ships are also ideal for individuals and corps to operate out of dev stations like moon city and arma.

T1 fuel rods are not as economic as T2, they require exorium to be hauled out for refills, where as T1 can be sustained with local nhurgite.

Combined with a SZ CLF hauler to generate credits, a new player can easily fund trips to the Ely belt, and can mine the materials for better ships and there own cap ship in time.
