//Design//

Unlike the Mk1 which was a modified Ghast, this has been built as its own ship, making use of the speed and convenience of the recycle tool to rend found salvage into mats.

This also makes it double as a cheap starter 8 crate hand miner, for both belt and surface.

Mainly made to act as a expendable salvage ship during cargo crisis events, you can fill the the ship and be in and out undetected very quickly.

Deliberately low tech and cheap, utilising stealthy manoeuvre thrusters to avoid direct fights in PvP zones, at the cost of prop range.

Plates are hidden inside the crate layer surrounding the critical components, to reduce lethality from hostile endos.

Can mount a tripod on various points of the ship, but top speed takes a serious dip.

Prop range can be increased with pocket fuel rigs (Prop tank + tank support + hardpoint + resource bridge)
